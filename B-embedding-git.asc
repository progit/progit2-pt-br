== Embedding Git in your Applications

If your application is for developers, chances are good that it could benefit from integration with source control.
Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from version-control features, and Git's model works very well for many different scenarios.

If you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially two options: spawn a shell and call the `git` command-line program, or embed a Git library into your application.
Here we'll cover command-line integration and several of the most popular embeddable Git libraries.
